# Data-Visualization-Tableau
This project is a in depth analysis and makes multiple visualizations on the dataset contaning Global Trade data of the top 20 economies in the world which heavily 
influence the trade policies. This project contains multiple intereactive dashboards and insightful graphs which were made with the help of tableau.

# Dataset-Description
This dataset contains the Global Trade data (data about import and export) based on multiple cateogries, which are also arranged based on the country and the year of the trade taking place. Even though a country may be a G20 country that does not mean it makes a net profit the tag of G20 comes based on the sum of net import and export, which is why we found a need to make a more indepth analysis analyzing the trends of countries and the items that they trade.

# Final Work
We chose to focus our efforts on first analyzing general trends of the global trade of the G20 countries and then focus on the trends of four specific countries which are Germany, Saudi, India and China. Finally finishing the workbook off with a competitor analysis based on certain products.
Here are some of the graphs from the workbook
