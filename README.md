# Data-Visualization-Tableau
This workbook is based on the global trade dataset available from the WTO site, in this workbook some of the visualizations have been made on 
the general trends in the global trade whereas the deeper insights have been made on four conutries which are Germany, Saudi, Indian and China.

The workbook is finally finished off with a Dashboard showing the trends of the top countries for a given product which helps us asses how these
countries are performing with respect to their competitors in certain fields over the years.
